## Technologies

Let's UI is a multi-brand design system built solely with a Sass/CSS structure and a JSON-based design token architecture.

Design tokens are maintained and scaled in JSON, using [Terrazzo](https://github.com/terrazzoapp/terrazzo) to generate the CSS custom properties file and the Sass variables map.

The design system includes a complete and compatible Figma library, enabling fast and agile interface creation, as well as the use of AI Agents for component creation and updates.
